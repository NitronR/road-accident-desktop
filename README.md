# Road Accident Detection Desktop

This desktop application allows us to select video(s) to play. Once the videos are selected, the monitor button can be clicked to start monitoring the video streams.
Images will be sampled from the streams and will be classified as accident or no accident.
If any image is predicted as accident, then the corresponding video stream will stop and the information of the accident will be sent to the admin web app.
